environment for reading, discovering, and interacting with content. You might
call it a [reader](http://indieweb.org/reader).

## Frontend Protoype

This is a [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) based frontend prototype. Currently for rapid experimentation and not in any sort of finished state.

### Running locally

Firstly you will need to have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed locally. Then to run the app in development mode simply clone this repo and run `yarn start` in the root directory.

This will start a local server at `localhost:3000` and open it in your browser for you. Changes are then live injected when you save a file.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

You can find out more about working with Create React App [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
