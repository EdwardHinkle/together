Password managers end up converting a password into a Possession Factor, since if someone steals the device that is storing my passwords, they would be able to use the passwords.

Something you know (Knowledge): A knowledge factor is something you know, such as your password. Something you have (Possession): Possession factors are something you have, such as a Yubikey, a phone, or some other physical security token. Something you are (Inherence): An Inherence factor is something you are, usually a biometric characteristic such as a fingerprint, voice pattern or iris pattern.

Lately, more systems are now requiring two factors of authentication, such as asking you for your password (Knowledge) and also requiring that you insert a security key (Possession).

knew. Make every day count, be kind, work hard, appreciate.<br class=\"auto-break\"></br><br class=\"auto-break\"></br>I saw the most beautiful sunrise over San Francisco and the Golden Gate Bridge that I’ve ever seen from Hawk Hill.<br class=\"auto-break\"></br><br class=\"auto-break\"></br>Thanks to Laura for choosing today’s hills and taking all the photos. Ever the <a class=\"auto-link h-cassis-username\" href=\"https://twitter.com/Nov_Project_SF\">@Nov_Project_SF</a> SF photographer, I snuck a backlit shot of her while she checked her DSLR.<br class=\"auto-break\"></br><br class=\"auto-break\"></br>30 minutes went by so quickly. The sun rose. Laura captured us in our post-trail-running excitement.<br class=\"auto-break\"></br><br class=\"auto-break\"></br>After we returned from running hills in the Marin Headlands we grabbed an early breakfast at Haight Street Market around 08:00.<br class=\"auto-break\"></br><br class=\"auto-break\"></br>It was cold out, the breeze crisper than usual.<br class=\"auto-break\"></br><br class=\"auto-break\"></br>Something about the angle of the morning sun this time of the year reminded me of the lox bagels I used to get many years ago. I ordered one from memory. Almond latte in my metal water bottle, from this year’s routine.<br class=\"auto-break\"></br><br class=\"auto-break\"></br>It was quieter, more muted in the market. After ordering I found out we lost Gus, co-owner of Haight Street Market, AKA Gus’s Community Market.<br class=\"auto-break\"></br><br class=\"auto-break\"></br><a class=\"auto-link\" href=\"http://hoodline.com/2017/09/gus-s-community-market-owner-killed-in-bayview-hit-and-run\">http://hoodline.com/2017/09/gus-s-community-market-owner-killed-in-bayview-hit-and-run</a><br class=\"auto-break\"></br><br class=\"auto-break\"></br>Market workers I’ve known for years were visibly shaken. All I could offer were a few words and hugs. I knew him as an acquaintance for so many years. Gus will be missed.

I saw the most beautiful sunrise over San Francisco and the Golden Gate Bridge that I’ve ever seen from Hawk Hill. Thanks to Laura for choosing today’s hills and taking all the photos. Ever the @Nov_Project_SF SF photographer, I snuck a backlit shot of her while she checked her DSLR. 30 minutes went by so quickly. The sun rose. Laura captured us in our post-trail-running excitement. After we returned from running hills in the Marin Headlands we grabbed an early breakfast at Haight Street Market around 08:00. It was cold out, the breeze crisper than usual. Something about the angle of the morning sun this time of the year reminded me of the lox bagels I used to get many years ago. I ordered one from memory. Almond latte in my metal water bottle, from this year’s routine. It was quieter, more muted in the market.
